	<div class="viewFullWidth">
<p>
The delivery and discovery capabilities of this site are implemented using a customized version
 of the open source <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/publishing/tools/xtf/">eXtensible Text Framework (XTF)</a> 
developed by the California Digital Library. It is served using the Tomcat application server and Apache HTTP Server software.
</p>
<p>
Local customizations to XTF at Indiana University include a unique native page image viewer and a page turner that are
both driven exclusively by the information encoded in the source TEI files and require no additional software beyond
what can be accomplished by customizing XTF's XSLT templates. This feature enables switching between text and page
images at any time while navigating a document's structure, and allows viewing of one or more page images as moveable
overlays simultaneously with the text in the paged text mode. The actual page images are stored and delivered via the
IU Digital Library Program's Fedora repository.
</p>

<p>
The facsimile page images for this project were originally processed as “two-up” images as opposed to a single page image view.  We maintain this “two-up” view in the migration and as a result had to make minor customizations to the image viewer.
</p>

<p>
The original texts are stored in a local e-text repository called Xubmit, which was developed by the IU Digital Library Program. 
Xubmit is comprised of web services using Java and Axis, the Revision Control System (RCS) for file versioning, and a 
graphical user interface developed in Java that is delivered using the Tomcat application server. Along with the 
XML/TEI P5 files, Xubmit stores the schema and Schematron files for the project as well.
</p>

<p>Digital page images were initially created by <a href="http://www.oclc.org/oclc/presres/">Preservation Resources</a>, a division of OCLC.</p>
